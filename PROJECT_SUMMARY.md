# ✅ Project Conversion Complete!

## 🎉 What Was Done

Your **SkyBook Flight Booking** website has been successfully converted from vanilla JavaScript to **React**!

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **CSS Image Path Error** ✅
- **Problem**: `Can't resolve 'images/airline-2.jpg'` in CSS
- **Solution**: Removed CSS background-image and added it as inline style in Hero component
- **Why**: CSS files in `src/` folder can't directly reference `public/` folder images
- **Fix**: Used `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` in Hero.js for proper image loading
- **Changed**: Moved from CSS `url()` to React inline style with `backgroundImage`

### 2. **Removed Educational Comments** ✅
- **Cleaned all `.js` files** - No more educational comments in code
- **Professional, production-ready code**
- **All explanations kept in documentation** (README.md, QUICKSTART.md, SYLLABUS_MAPPING.md)

### 3. **Fixed All Warnings** ✅
- Fixed unused variable in SearchFlights.js
- Changed anchor tag to button in Header.js (accessibility)
- Zero errors, zero warnings in final build
